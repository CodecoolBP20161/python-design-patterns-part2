# Template

Codecoolers and their mentors are really similar. Their day @ Codecool is built upon the same routine tasks:

1. before school, they do their morning ritual: they drink coffee (mentors are older, so they drink a double espresso, while for  codecoolers a simple one does the trick)
2. they do their morning job before noon (mentors are helping, codecoolers are learning)
3. they eat lunch at noon
4. they do their afternoon job after lunch (mentors are keeping private mentoring, codecoolers are having private mentoring)
5. after school they do their late-afternoon routine (mentors are preparing for the future, codecoolers are playing foosball)

Write a Mentor and a Codecooler class, and move the common logic to a template class called CodecoolPersonTemplate.
